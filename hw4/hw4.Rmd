# is_valid

This function was to validate the graph object to ensure that it meets the following requirements. 

1) The object is a list of lists.
2) If the object has names for the primary list, they are all unique. 
3) Each secondary list in the graph object contains only edges and weights vectors
4) The types of edges are integers and weights are double.
5) The vertices that the values in the edges vector direct exist.    
6) The values in the weights exist, they are greater than 0. 
7) The edges and the weights vectors have the same length.

In doing so, we create a function that has 7 internal tests. If a graph object fails one of the tests, the function stops there and retunrs "FAIL." For the function to return "TRUE,"  the graph object has to pass all seven internal tests. Explanation for how each test is constructed is as follows.

First, in testing
