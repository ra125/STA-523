The graph we generated summarizes the information of the goals by the players of the final four countries: Germany (champion), Argentina (runner up), Netherlands (third place), and Brazil (fourth place). Represented by its own flag, each country graph shows the range of goals and the time (in minutes) that the goal was scored, as well as the name of the goaler. As the champion, Germany made the most goals among the four countries. In contrast, Argentina has made its way up as a good defensive team. In terms of the style in aggression, Germany scored many of its goals early on while the Netherlands scored many of its goals later towards the end of the second half.
