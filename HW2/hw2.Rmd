#This histogram has lots of information. However, it would not be so convincing if we
#argue that "because the density are more accumulated at small value of distance, so that
#lq is a spanish next to denney's".

#There are two reasons that the logics of this argument could fail:
#First, notice that the x-axis has very large range, because we not only include those 
#stores in the mainland of US, but also Hawii, and Alaska, and so on. So, even through the distance
#(bin size is 1km) with highest frequency seems to close to origin, it may not correspond to the 
#"closeness" we usually refer to according to our daily experience. Actually, by calculating the 
#mode of the distribution, the distance of most highest frequency is about: (225 km)
#Second, it could be possible that Denney's tends to concentrate around lq, so that the distance
#would be counted at whatever times the same number Denney's locates near that lq, but our objective
#is not to test "how dense the Denney's locate near lq." 

#count the number of pairs of (lq, denney's) whose distance falls in an interval of mile

#Calculate the minimum distance between lq and denney's for every lq 
#(in other words, apply max function across rows of "distance")
#That's because we want to check the validity of the blogger's statement
#of "lq is a spanish next to denney's". So if he was true, for every
#occurance of lq, there should be an denney's next to it.

#By calculating the minimum of distance between pair of (lq, denneys), 
#We define a variable measuring how close these two can be. It's distribution
#would give us a database to check the blogger's statement, say, for a given
#upper bound of distance indicating "lq is next to denney's", 
#how many percentages of lq can statisfy this condition, thus support blogger's
#statement.
