#Calculate the minimum distance between lq and denney's for every lq 
#(in other words, apply max function across rows of "distance")
#That's because we want to check the validity of the blogger's statement
#of "lq is a spanish next to denney's". So if he was true, for every
#occurance of lq, there should be an denney's next to it.

#By calculating the minimum of distance between pair of (lq, denneys), 
#We define a variable measuring how close these two can be. It's distribution
#would give us a database to check the blogger's statement, say, for a given
#upper bound of distance indicating "lq is next to denney's", 
#how many percentages of lq can statisfy this condition, thus support blogger's
#statement.

#If we set 0.1 km as standard of "closeness", the blogger's claim is true at below percentage and frequency:
print(paste("Per:",pmindislq(0.1)*100,"%",",","Freq:",pmindislq(0.1)*nlq))

#If increase the threshold to 0.5 km, the corresponding percentage and frequency:
print(paste("Per:",pmindislq(0.5)*100,"%",",","Freq:",pmindislq(0.5)*nlq))

#If increase the threshold to 1 km, the corresponding percentage and frequency:
print(paste("Per:",pmindislq(1)*100,"%",",","Freq:",pmindislq(1)*nlq))

#At these percentage, it is reasonable that the blogger said "LaQuenta is Spanish next to Denney's".
#However, truely speaking, his claim can be wrong for most of cases.
