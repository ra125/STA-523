In order to calculate the distance between La Quinta and Denny’s, we firstly transformed the coordinates of latitude and longitude for each La Quinta and Denny’s into the plane coordinates.  Second, we made a matrix of distance of every pairs of La Quinta and Denny’s. Then, we defined a variable to measure the minimum distance (km) between these two for every La Quinta. In order to verify the blogger’s statement that “La Quinta is next to Denny’s”, we need to check how many percentages of La Quinta are close to Denny’s. For this, we made three plots; the frequency histogram, the CDF curve and the Quantile curve which are about the minimum distance between La Quinta and Denny’s for every La Quinta. 

First, in the CDF curve, we can easily notice that the curve rapidly increases in the range between 0 to 100km and then, a little bit slowly increases from 100 to 300km. From 300km, there is a gentle slope. That means about 60% of La Quinta are located closely near Denny’s within 100km and 90% are located within 300km. In the Quantile curve plot, we can see the same thing as the CDF curve. 

Second, we want to take a closer look at the minimum distance (0 to 100km) in the frequency histogram, we can see that x-axis indicates minimum distance between La Quinta and Denny’s which ranged from 0 to 100km and y-axis indicates the frequency of the minimum distance for every La Quinta. This histogram shows that most La Quintas are in the minimum distance 0 to 20km with Denny’s.
